# Learn Nano by Building a Bash Script

> Welcome to the Nano lessons!

## 10. Start the Terminal

### 10.1

**The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.** Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello terminal` into the terminal and press enter.

- Capitalization matters
- If the tests don't run automatically, try typing `exit` into the terminal and redoing the instructions

## 20. Touch `my-script.sh`

Touch my-script.sh

#### HINTS

- Use the touch command to create the file

- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there

## 30. Nano `my-script.sh`

Leave it as `bash-script.sh` and press enter to save the file.
